  description: Does your app show a people list that includes telephone numbers or Skype for Business Ids? How cool would it be if your app could launch a new chat, audio, or video call in the Skype for Business client installed on the Android device? With the code in this sample, all you need to do is ask a user to pick a person from your list (along with the associated phone number or Skype address), pick chat, audio, or video, and with a few lines of code, your app launches Skype in a new full screen activity. The call is already queued with the phone number or id.
